# The-Last-Move-Game
I made this game by using pyhton without any libraries for the project of algorithm and programing class.

Game Rules:
Last Move game is a strategy game played with 2 people. The playing field is 7X7 in size and consists 
of 49 squares. In the game, each player is represented by a big stone of different colors. There are 
also small stones that players jointly use to place on the squares on the playing field. The aim of the 
game is to make the opponent player unable to move with the help of stones and boundary lines.
